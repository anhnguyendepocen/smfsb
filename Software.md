# Software

### Software associated with the book, Stochastic Modelling for Systems Biology, third edition

## R package

R is free software, available for all major operating systems, and can be obtained from the [R project website](http://www.r-project.org/) (or a mirror). The R code associated with this book is freely available as an R package, which is maintained on [R-Forge](http://r-forge.r-project.org/) and distributed via [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/). It should be possible to install it by entering the following command at the R command prompt:

```r
install.packages("smfsb")
```

On platforms where binary package installs are the default (eg. Windows), the binary package may not install on older versions of R - if installation fails, try updating R to the latest version, or find out about installing packages from source. See the [R-Forge project](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/smfsb/) and [CRAN listing](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/smfsb/) for further information and source code. The package does work on all major operating systems (Linux, Windows, Mac, ...). Please try consulting the available information on CRAN and R-Forge before emailing me about installation problems.

Once the smfsb package is installed, it can be loaded with

```r
library(smfsb)
```
and an overview vignette can be accessed by using the command
```r
vignette("smfsb",package="smfsb")
```
There should be sufficient information provided in the vignette in order to get started with using the package.
